# MangaBrowser
A program for browsing manga that is stored locally on your hard drive

When you run the program, it will ask for a root directory, this is the directory where your manga is stored.

This directory should have a manganames.txt, where each line in that text file is the name of a folder containing a manga. The names of each folder are assumed to be the names of the manga they contain with '-' instead of spaces.
